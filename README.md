# Cat Racing Game
This game was created for a project in 2022-2023. It was a way to practice utilizing JOptionPane and using images from the PC/Laptop in the code. It was also good practice for creating simple forms of motion.

## Building and Running
- In the past, I've used both Eclipse and IntelliJ to compile and run this project. Feel free to use whatever is most convenient and works for you.
- Be sure all the PNGs are in the same directory as the Java file. If not, you'll have to change pieces of code to access the images in the game.
- This game functions in a similar way to horse racing. Once you run the game, you'll be prompted on if you wish to read the instructions, if you wish to look at the randomly generated stats, which cats you would like to bet on, and which form of motion you would like to be used for the race, all in that order. 
- The names of the cats are determined by their colour, and by their randomized stats. 
- Follow the instructions and you should have little issues.

## Credits

- I do not own any of the images in this project, but I did recolour the cats to fit certain colour schemes.
